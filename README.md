- Run: docker-compose up
- Open the browser on localhost:5000/run_pipe/<date>, where date is a ficticious date.
e.g. \
```localhost:5000/run_pipe/2021-01-01```

- Access all orders and its details on ```localhost:5000/order_details```

That is it.

There are some other endpoints to check files, and apply constraints as well.\
Best regards. =)
